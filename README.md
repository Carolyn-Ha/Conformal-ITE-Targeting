# Conformal-ITE-Targeting
2024 Statistics Academic Paper Contest

## 📌 Overview
This repository implements a data-driven framework for estimating individual treatment effects (ITE) of youth employment policies using Conformal Prediction, with the goal of identifying high-impact and reliable target groups for policy intervention.

Using the 2020 Graduates Occupational Mobility Survey (GOMS), the pipeline quantifies both effect magnitude and predictive uncertainty at the individual level, enabling precision targeting under limited policy resources.

## 🎯 Key Contributions
- Conformal Prediction–based ITE estimation with finite-sample uncertainty guarantees
- A reliability score combining ITE median and confidence interval length
- Identification of the top 25% high-impact & high-confidence individuals
- Interpretable characterization of target groups using Logistic Regression and Random Forests
